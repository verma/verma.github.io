I hate writing a ton of text, so I'll get straight to it. This is Datascript 101! A series of short tutorials that will help me (and probably you) understand and document some of the things I'd like to do with Datascript.

**Bonus**: Most of it also applies to Datomic!

I would assume you're set and ready to go (aka not disucssing installation, IDE setup, Clojure(script) syntax etc.).

If you've always dreaded Datascript/Datomic/Datalog like me, here's something to get you started:

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
