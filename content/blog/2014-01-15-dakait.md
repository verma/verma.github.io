I am starting to learn [Clojure](http://clojure.org), just because its full of badassary and would help lessen the work stress.

I also need a tool to manage my downloads, so that I can tag files on my remote FTP/SFTP servers and they get downloaded to local directories organized nicely into categories and what not.

So I am starting this project called [dakait](https://github.com/verma/dakait).  I hope to provide a web interface for tagging files on configured remote servers which then get downloaded without me having to run a ftp client or manually downloading them.  By the way, ___dakait___ is a hindi word for a pirate/robber.

So I hope I find time to learn and play with clojure, and get this thing to work.  I'd start commiting code real soon.
